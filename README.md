## About:

This project was our final project and counted as our final exam for the semester. The professor asked about building a software from the ground up by using any technology we wanted. We were placed into different groups of three to five people. The goal of this project was to give us an idea of software engineering best practices. We learned about interaction between the development team and the client, designing the project based on client needs by using personas, scenarios and user stories. We also learned about popular software methodologies such as agile and scrum. After having distributed responsabilities among members, we organized ourselves by doing small scrum meeting to discuss features and functionalities, and made sure we stayed updated with the client (The professor).
